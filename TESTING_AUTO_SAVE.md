2. Start the Pomodoro timer (press Play)
3. Wait for at least 1 minute
4. Press Home button to minimize the app
5. Open Recent Apps (multitasking menu)
6. **Swipe away the app to force-close it**
7. Reopen the app
8. ✅ **Expected**: Your ~1 minute of study time should be saved and visible in the total study time!

### Test 2: Quick Force Close (Less than 5 seconds)
1. Open the app
2. Start the timer
3. Wait 3 seconds
4. Force-close the app from recent apps
5. Reopen the app
6. ✅ **Expected**: At least a few seconds should be saved (may lose up to 5 seconds max)

### Test 3: Longer Session
1. Open the app
2. Start the timer
3. Wait 5-10 minutes
4. Force-close the app
5. Reopen the app
6. ✅ **Expected**: All your study time saved (minus at most 5 seconds)

### Test 4: Pause and Force Close
1. Start the timer
2. Wait 1-2 minutes
3. Press Pause
4. Force-close the app
5. Reopen the app
6. ✅ **Expected**: Study time should be saved

### Test 5: Battery Dies Simulation
1. Start the timer
2. Wait a few minutes
3. Turn off your phone (simulates battery death)
4. Turn phone back on
5. Open the app
6. ✅ **Expected**: Study time saved (minus at most 5 seconds)

## What Changed to Fix the Issue

### The Problem
When you force-closed the app from recent apps, Android doesn't always call the lifecycle methods (`onPause`, `onStop`, `onCleared`), so the timer state wasn't being saved reliably.

### The Solution
**Periodic Auto-Save Every 5 Seconds**
- Timer now saves its state automatically every 5 seconds while running
- State is saved immediately when timer starts
- On app restart, ANY saved session is recovered and saved to your study time
- Maximum possible data loss: 5 seconds (the time since last auto-save)

### Technical Details
- Auto-save happens in the background every 5 seconds
- Uses Android's DataStore for reliable persistence
- Timer automatically resets to 25:00 after recovery (clean slate)
- Your study time is always preserved in the total time counter

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **Force-close from recent apps** → Study time SAVED
✅ **Phone shuts down** → Study time SAVED
✅ **App crashes** → Study time SAVED
✅ **Battery dies** → Study time SAVED
✅ **Maximum data loss** → Only 5 seconds (time since last auto-save)

## If It Still Doesn't Work

If you're still experiencing issues, please check:
1. Make sure you're testing with the latest build
2. Wait at least 5 seconds after starting the timer before force-closing
3. Check the Dashboard/Stats screen to see if your study time was recorded
4. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the app to clear old data

## Build Status
✅ App builds successfully
✅ No lint errors
